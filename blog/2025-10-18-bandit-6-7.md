# Bandit Level 6 to 7

Login : ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220  
password : HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG

### task :
Find a file somewhere on the server with these properties:  
-owned by user bandit7  
-owned by group bandit6  
-exactly 33 bytes in size 

### Theory lil bit:  
1. `ls -l` shows owner and group (3rd and 4th columns).
2. Example: `-rw-r----- 1 bandit7 bandit6 33 ... bandit7.password → user bandit7, group bandit6, size 33.`
4. find can search by owner and group: `-user <name>`, `-group <name>`.
4. Use `-type f` to restrict to regular files and `-size 33c` to match exactly 33 bytes (c = bytes).
5. Searching from `/` can produce many “Permission denied” messages; redirect stderr to `/dev/null` with `2>/dev/null` to hide them.


### solution:

```bash
bandit6@bandit:~$ find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
bandit6@bandit:~$ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
