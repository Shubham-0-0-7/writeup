# SOC L1 Alert Triage: System and Workflow

## 1. System Overview
The SOC L1 analyst acts as the verification layer between automated detection systems and manual incident response.

* **Data Source:** Endpoints (laptops, servers), Firewalls, and Cloud services generate raw logs.
* **Aggregation:** A SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tool collects these logs.
* **Detection:** The SIEM applies logic rules (correlations) to the logs.
* **Output:** When a rule condition is met, an **Alert** is generated.

The L1 role is to validate whether the Alert represents a real security threat or a system error (noise).

## 2. The Triage Lifecycle
The workflow follows a standard logic gate to ensure alerts are handled efficiently.

### Step A: Queue Management
Alerts appear in a dashboard queue. They must be selected based on a specific hierarchy to minimize risk.

1.  **Severity:** Prioritize Critical and High alerts first. These represent immediate threats (e.g., Ransomware, Data Exfiltration).
2.  **Time:** If severity is equal, prioritize the oldest alert.
3.  **Assignment:** The analyst must assign the alert to themselves. This locks the ticket and prevents duplication of effort.

### Step B: Contextual Analysis
An alert provides a timestamp and a trigger event. The analyst must query surrounding data to understand the **Intent**.

* **User Context:** Is the user's behavior anomalous?
    * *Example:* A Human Resources user running PowerShell scripts is suspicious. A Developer doing the same is likely normal.
* **Host Context:** What is the function of the machine?
    * *Example:* High traffic on a web server is normal; high traffic on a printer is suspicious.
* **External Intelligence:**
    * Check destination IPs against reputation databases (e.g., AbuseIPDB, Talos).
    * Check file hashes against VirusTotal.

### Step C: The Decision (Logic Gate)
Every alert must end in a binary decision.

**1. False Positive (Benign)**
The system logic triggered correctly, but the activity is not malicious.
* **Causes:** Legitimate administrative work, software updates, or overly broad detection rules.
* **Action:** Close the alert. Note the business justification (e.g., "User authorized to install Spotify").

**2. True Positive (Malicious)**
The activity is unauthorized and harmful.
* **Causes:** Malware execution, credential theft, unauthorized access.
* **Action:** Escalate to L2/Incident Response. The L1 typically prepares the evidence package but does not perform the containment (isolation/wiping) themselves.

## 3. Technical Indicators
When analyzing raw logs during Triage, look for these specific anomalies:

* **Parent-Child Process Drift:**
    * Standard: `explorer.exe` opens `chrome.exe`.
    * Suspicious: `winword.exe` (Word) opens `powershell.exe`. This suggests a malicious macro.
* **Beaconing:**
    * Consistent, rhythmic network connections to an external IP at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes). This indicates Command and Control (C2) communication.
* **Double Extensions:**
    * Files named `document.pdf.exe` or `invoice.xlsx.scr`. The system hides the final extension, tricking the user into executing a binary.

## 4. Operational Reality vs. Theory
* **Noise:** In a production environment, SIEM rules drift. Valid software updates often trigger "System Modification" alerts. The majority of L1 work is filtering out this noise.
* **Living off the Land:** Attackers often use standard administrative tools (PowerShell, PsExec) to blend in. The SIEM cannot distinguish between an Admin using PowerShell and a Hacker using PowerShell. The analyst must verify the **source** and **intent** manually.
