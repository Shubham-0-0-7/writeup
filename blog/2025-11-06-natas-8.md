## Natas 8

### Solution
okay so the first thing that will come to our mind while visiting the page will be clicking that `View sourcecode` button.   
when you will visit that page you will find an encoded secret, you have to decode it   
but we are given a function in php to encode secret ... so to decode it we will implement that in reverse order 

```php
function encodeSecret($secret) {
    return bin2hex(strrev(base64_encode($secret)));
}
```

`bin2hex(strrev(base64_encode($secret))` produced `3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362`   
reverse these steps to get the secret 

make sure you have php installed on your pc/laptop ... 
then execute following commands.  

```bash
shubhamdchhatbar@shubhams-MacBook-Air ~ % php -a
Interactive shell

php > echo base64_decode(strrev(hex2bin('3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362')));
oubWYf2kBq
php > 
```

submit this `oubWYf2kBq` and you will get password for natas 9
