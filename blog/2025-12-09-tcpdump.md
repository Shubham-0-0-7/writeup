# Tcpdump: The Basics

## What is Tcpdump

okay let me go through it straightforward  

tcpdump is a command-line packet analyzer. it captures packets directly from a network interface or reads them from a saved pcap file, then prints packet details.

lame language definition:  
tcpdump is like a tiny network spy that listens to all traffic on an interface  

formal definition:  
tcpdump is a libpcap-based command-line tool that intercepts, filters, and displays packets for diagnostics, forensics, and network monitoring purposes.

## Why Tcpdump Matters

- runs on servers without GUI  
- extremely lightweight, ideal for quick captures  
- can save captures to .pcap and analyze later in Wireshark  
- useful for debugging network connectivity  
- helps detect suspicious/malicious traffic  
- allows automated/scripted packet captures

lame language definition:  
when something weird happens on your network, tcpdump shows what’s actually flowing over the wire  

formal definition:  
tcpdump provides packet-level visibility for troubleshooting, auditing, and security monitoring by capturing and filtering traffic directly from network interfaces.

## Basic Usage & Important Options

common options you’ll use:

- `**-i <interface>**` → choose interface (eth0, wlan0, lo, any)  
- `**-n / -nn**` → show numeric IPs/ports (no DNS or service-name resolution)  
- `**-c <count>**` → stop after N packets  
- `**-w <file>**` → write packets to a pcap for later analysis  
- `**-r <file>**` → read a saved pcap file  

general syntax:  
tcpdump [options] [filter expression]

## Filtering Packets

tcpdump filters are extremely powerful and help cut noise.

examples:

- capture only ICMP  
  icmp  

- capture HTTP port 80  
  port 80  

- capture packets from a specific IP  
  src 192.168.1.10  

- capture packets to a specific IP  
  dst 10.0.0.5  

- combine filters  
  tcp and port 443 and src 10.10.10.50  

filters let you focus on exactly what matters.

## Reading vs Capturing

tcpdump can:

- capture live packets  
- save packets to a file  
- read files created earlier  
- monitor remote servers via SSH  
- create captures you later open in Wireshark

this makes it versatile for both live debugging and offline analysis.

---

## What Tcpdump Output Usually Looks Like

each printed line typically includes:

- timestamp  
- protocol (IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP)  
- src_ip:src_port → dst_ip:dst_port  
- tcp flags (if applicable)  
- packet length or other metadata  

this gives quick insight into what traffic is flowing without needing a full GUI analyzer.

---

## When to Use Tcpdump vs Wireshark

use tcpdump when you need:

- fast text-based packet capture  
- minimal system footprint  
- SSH-based remote analysis  
- automated or scripted packet recording  
- only basic header/payload visibility  

use wireshark when you need UI-level detail, protocol trees, reassembly, or file extraction.

---

## Security Use Cases

- capture suspicious outbound connections  
- inspect DNS or ARP traffic during enumeration  
- detect plaintext credentials in unencrypted protocols  
- gather evidence during incident response  
- perform reconnaissance on unknown networks  
- analyze malware communications on isolated machines  

tcpdump is extremely useful in cybersecurity because it provides raw, unfiltered network truth.

## Conclusion

tcpdump is simple, powerful, and essential.  
it lets you capture, filter, analyze, and save network packets — even on systems with no graphical environment.

if you understand tcpdump basics, filters, interface selection, and capture options,  
you already have one of the strongest command-line packet analysis tools in your toolkit.
