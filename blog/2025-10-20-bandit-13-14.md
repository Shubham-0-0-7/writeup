# Bandit Level 13 → 14 — using a private SSH key

**Login**: `ssh bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`\
(you already logged in as `bandit13` and found `sshkey.private` in the home directory)

**Task**

You are given a private SSH key file (`sshkey.private`) in the `bandit13` home directory. Use that key locally to connect to the `bandit14` account. After you successfully ssh to `bandit14`, read the file `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14` to get the next level password.

---

## Quick solution (commands)

```bash
# copy the private key from the remote host to your local machine
scp -P 2220 bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:sshkey.private .

# secure the key locally (OpenSSH requires strict permissions)
chmod 600 sshkey.private

# use the key to login as bandit14
ssh -i sshkey.private -p 2220 bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org

# once logged in as bandit14, read the password for the next level
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
```

## Theory (a bit more — why this works)

1. **Public-key SSH authentication**

   - Instead of a password, SSH can use an *asymmetric key-pair*: a private key (which you keep secret) and a public key (stored on the server).
   - If the server has the corresponding public key in the `authorized_keys` of an account, SSH proves you own the private key and logs you in as that account.
   - In this level you were given the *private* key for `bandit14`. Possessing that key is equivalent to having the password for `bandit14` (for authentication purposes).

2. **scp**

   - `scp` copies files over SSH. The `-P 2220` option tells scp to use port `2220` (Bandit uses that port).
   - Example: `scp -P 2220 bandit13@...:sshkey.private .` copies `sshkey.private` from the remote `bandit13` home to your current local directory.

3. **File permissions matter**

   - OpenSSH refuses to use private key files that are readable by group or others. If a private key file is group/world-readable SSH prints a warning like:
     ```
     Permissions 0640 for 'sshkey.private' are too open.
     ```
   - The correct permission for private keys is `` (`-rw-------`) so that only the file owner can read/write it. `700` (`-rwx------`) also works but is non-standard (private keys usually don't need execute bit).
   - Use `chmod 600 sshkey.private` to fix permissions.

4. **Windows line endings**

   - If the key was moved through Windows or edited with a Windows editor, it may contain CRLF (` `) line endings. SSH expects Unix LF (` `). Convert with `dos2unix` or a `tr` command if needed.

5. **Troubleshooting**

   - If SSH refuses to authenticate, add verbose output to see why:
     ```bash
     ssh -vvv -i sshkey.private -p 2220 bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
     ```
     Look for messages about `Offering public key` and `Authentication succeeded` or `Permission denied`.
   - If you still get `Permission denied (publickey)`, confirm:
     - The key file content is intact (no accidental edits).
     - File permissions are `600` and ownership is your user.
     - You used the correct user (`bandit14`) and port (`2220`).

6. **ssh-agent alternative**

   - Instead of passing `-i` every time, add the key to your agent (keeps it in memory):
     ```bash
     ssh-add sshkey.private
     ssh -p 2220 bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
     ```

## Full explained session (step-by-step)

1. **On the remote server (bandit13)** — you discovered the key:

```
bandit13@bandit:~$ ls
sshkey.private
```

2. **From your local machine** — copy the key here for use:

```bash
scp -P 2220 bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:sshkey.private .
# you will be prompted for the bandit13 password
```

3. **Secure the key file**

```bash
# make it readable only by you
chmod 600 sshkey.private
# verify
ls -l sshkey.private
# output should look like: -rw------- 1 youruser yourgroup 1675 Sep 19 12:34 sshkey.private
```

4. **Attempt SSH using the key**

```bash
ssh -i sshkey.private -p 2220 bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
```

- On first connect you'll likely be asked to accept the host fingerprint — answer `yes`.
- If the key works you'll be dropped into a shell as `bandit14`.

5. **Read the next-level password**

```bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
# this prints the password you need for the next level
```

## Example (what you might see)

```
$ scp -P 2220 bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:sshkey.private .
bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password:
sshkey.private                          100% 1675   1.6KB/s   00:00

$ chmod 600 sshkey.private
$ ssh -i sshkey.private -p 2220 bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
The authenticity of host '[bandit.labs.overthewire.org]:2220 ([IP]:2220)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Welcome to bandit...
$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
<the-password-for-bandit15>
```

## Cleanup & security reminder

- This is a game environment, but in real life **never** share private keys publicly (e.g., push them to GitHub). Remove keys from your local machine when you no longer need them:

```bash
shred -u sshkey.private   # securely delete
# or simply: rm sshkey.private
```

- If you ever suspect a private key has been exposed, revoke it on the server (remove the corresponding public key from `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`) and generate a new key pair.

---

If you want, I can:

- shorten this into a one-page `README.md` suitable for GitHub, or
- create a small diagram explaining public/private key flow, or
- add the exact `ssh -vvv` debugging output to the doc (if you paste your session output).

Tell me which you prefer and I will update the file.
