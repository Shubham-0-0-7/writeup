## Natas 7

## Solution 
if we click on about, the web server will append `/index.php?page=about` to the end of the url  
if we view the page source ../ we see a comment in both pages:  
` hint: password for webuser natas8 is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8 `

if we try to visit `/etc/natas_webpass/natas8` directly ... we will encounter `Not Found` error.   

but if we try to visit it while we are in home ... that is: `http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=home/etc/natas_webpass/natas8`

we will get a warning which goes like 
```bash
Warning: include(home/etc/natas_webpass/natas8): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/natas/natas7/index.php on line 21

Warning: include(): Failed opening 'home/etc/natas_webpass/natas8' for inclusion (include_path='.:/usr/share/php') in /var/www/natas/natas7/index.php on line 21
```


error messages are frequently useful for getting a working exploit ... you can see that the web server tried and failed to open filename "home", and also told us the file path.   
from here ...  we can either use an absolute file path (ex: /etc/passwd) or a relative file path (../../../../etc/passwd).  

lets use the absolute file path option, and navigate to `http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=/etc/natas_webpass/natas8.` This will include the flag file and display it to us.
