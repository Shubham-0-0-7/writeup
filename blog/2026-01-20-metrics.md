# SOC Metrics and Objectives: System and Workflow

## 1. System Overview
A SOC (Security Operations Center) is an expensive "Black Box" for a company. Management puts money in, and they want to know if "Security" is coming out.
To prove value and efficiency, the SOC relies on **Metrics** (KPIs). These numbers tell you if the system is working or if the analysts are drowning.

* **The Goal:** Detect faster, Respond faster, and reduce Noise.
* **The Mechanism:** Service Level Agreements (SLAs). These are "Contracts" (e.g., "We promise to look at every Critical alert within 10 minutes").

## 2. The Time-Based Metrics (The Clock)
Security is a race against time. These metrics measure the speed of the pipeline.

### A. MTTD (Mean Time to Detect)
* **Definition:** Time from **Entry** (Hack starts) -> **Alert Generation** (SIEM fires).
* **System Component:** This measures the **Technology** (SIEM/Sensors).
* **Failure Mode:** If MTTD is high (e.g., 20 mins), your SIEM rules are running too slowly (scheduled searches vs. real-time) or your logs are delayed.

### B. MTTA (Mean Time to Acknowledge)
* **Definition:** Time from **Alert Generation** -> **Analyst Assignment** (Status: In Progress).
* **System Component:** This measures the **Human Capacity**.
* **Failure Mode:** If MTTA is high, you don't have enough analysts, or they are ignoring the queue (Burnout).
* **Target:** < 10 Minutes for Critical.

### C. MTTR (Mean Time to Respond/Remediate)
* **Definition:** Time from **Alert Generation** -> **Threat Contained** (e.g., Host Isolated).
* **System Component:** This measures **Process Efficiency**.
* **Failure Mode:** If MTTR is high (e.g., 6 hours), your analysts don't know what to do. They lack Workbooks or Access Rights (e.g., waiting for IT to reset a password).

## 3. The Quality Metrics (The Noise)
Speed doesn't matter if you are chasing ghosts. These metrics measure the *accuracy* of the pipeline.

### A. FPR (False Positive Rate)
* **Formula:** `False Positives / Total Alerts`
* **The Danger Zone:** If FPR > **80%**, the system is broken.
* **Consequence:** "Alert Fatigue." Analysts stop treating alerts seriously because "it's usually nothing."
* **Fix:** Tune the SIEM rules (Exclude trusted updaters/scanners).

### B. AER (Alert Escalation Rate)
* **Formula:** `Escalated Alerts / Total Alerts`
* **Context:** Measures L1 autonomy.
* **Failure Mode:** If L1 escalates 50% of tickets, they aren't filtering. They are just passing the buck to L2.
* **Target:** < 20%.

## 4. Lab Scenarios: Debugging the SOC
In the provided lab, you acted as a Manager fixing broken processes.

* **Scenario 1: High MTTR (Slow Fix)**
    * *Symptom:* It took 5 hours to reset a password.
    * *Root Cause:* No process. The analyst didn't know how to rotate credentials.
    * *Fix:* Create a **Workbook**. (Process > People).
    * *Flag:* `THM{mttr:quick_start_but_slow_response}`

* **Scenario 2: High MTTD (Slow Detection)**
    * *Symptom:* The team sat idle for 20 mins while the hack was happening.
    * *Root Cause:* SIEM rules were scheduled to run every 30 mins, not real-time.
    * *Fix:* **Tune the SIEM** schedule. (Technology Issue).
    * *Flag:* `THM{mttd:time_between_attack_and_alert}`

* **Scenario 3: High FPR (Burnout)**
    * *Symptom:* L1s closing 760 alerts/shift. 95% noise.
    * *Root Cause:* IT automation scripts triggering alerts.
    * *Fix:* **Tune Rules** to exclude IT noise.
    * *Flag:* `THM{fpr:the_main_cause_of_l1_burnout}`

## 5. Operational Reality
* **The "Zero Alert" Fallacy:** If a SOC sees **Zero** alerts for a month, it isn't "Secure." It means the sensors are broken or the rules are blind.
* **Gaming the System:** Analysts might close tickets too fast (without real investigation) just to keep their MTTR low. This is why **Quality Assurance (QA)** is vital.
* **Weekend Lag:** If a team works 8/5 (Mon-Fri) and a hack happens on Saturday, the MTTA will be huge (Monday morning). Attackers know this and prefer weekends.
