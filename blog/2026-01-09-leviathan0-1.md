## Leviathan 0 to 1 

we already know password for leviathan0 so we will login using ssh   
`ssh leviathan0@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223`
then type the password `leviathan0`  

now if you see there are no files
that means files are hidden  
use `ls -la` command to list the files that are hidden also  

```bash
leviathan0@leviathan:~$ ls -la
total 24
drwxr-xr-x   3 root       root       4096 Oct 14 09:27 .
drwxr-xr-x 150 root       root       4096 Oct 14 09:29 ..
drwxr-x---   2 leviathan1 leviathan0 4096 Oct 14 09:27 .backup
-rw-r--r--   1 root       root        220 Mar 31  2024 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r--   1 root       root       3851 Oct 14 09:19 .bashrc
-rw-r--r--   1 root       root        807 Mar 31  2024 .profile
```

here we can clearly see leviathan1 in .backup directory   
now change directory to .backup then we have one html file named bookmarks.html, now if you do `cat bookmarks.html`  
thats so long output   
```bash
leviathan0@leviathan:~/.backup$ cat bookmarks.html | grep leviathan
<DT><A HREF="http://leviathan.labs.overthewire.org/passwordus.html | This will be fixed later, the password for leviathan1 is 3QJ3TgzHDq" ADD_DATE="1155384634" LAST_CHARSET="ISO-8859-1" ID="rdf:#$2wIU71">password to leviathan1</A>
```   

so we used `grep` to filter  

and yeah we got the password to leviathan 1 
this was just practice or you say warm up type question, there was no such reverse engineering stuff as such.
