## Natas 9

### Solution
first thing you are likely to click here is `View sourcecode`

there you will see something like this   
```php
<?
$key = "";

if(array_key_exists("needle", $_REQUEST)) {
    $key = $_REQUEST["needle"];
}

if($key != "") {
    passthru("grep -i $key dictionary.txt");
}
?>
```
here passthru() function is used ... read more about it on https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.passthru.php#127699 


since passthru is there we can use command injection ...  
basically it is an attack which executes the arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application ... read [OWASP Command Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Command_Injection) for more information.  


in `Find words containing` search box   
write `;ls -a`  you will see the files 
now on the official website it is given that password can be found on `etc/natas_webpass/natas*`   

so we will execute the command `; cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10;`
and will get the password for natas 10   
`<!-- truncate -->`
