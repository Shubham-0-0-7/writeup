# Bandit Level 5 to 6

Login : ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220  
password : 4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw

### task :
The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:   -human-readable  
1033 bytes in size  
-not executable  

### Theory lil bit:  
1. `file <path>` — reports a file’s type (e.g. ASCII text = human readable).  
2. `*` and brace expansion `{.,}*` — wildcard patterns; `{.,}*` helps include dotfiles (hidden files).  
3. `|` (pipe) — sends output of one command as input to another (e.g. file ... | grep ASCII).  
4. `grep PATTERN` — filter lines that match PATTERN; `grep -v PATTERN` inverts (exclude lines).  
5. `du -b -a` — lists file sizes in bytes (-b) for all files (-a).  
6. `find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable -exec file '{}' \; —` find regular files of exact size 1033 bytes (1033c), that are non-executable (! -executable), and run file on each result.  

### solution:



```bash
bandit5@bandit:~$ ls
inhere
bandit5@bandit:~$ cd inhere
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ ls -la

### or we also have one liner!!!

```bash
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable -exec file '{}' \; | grep ASCII
./maybehere07/.file2: ASCII text, with very long lines (1000)
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./maybehere07/.file2
