# SOC L1 Alert Reporting: System and Workflow

## 1. System Overview
Triage is just the filtering mechanism. **Reporting** is the output mechanism.
After validating an alert (Triage), the information must be structured and moved upstream. This phase bridges the gap between "I found something" and "We fixed it."

* **L1 Role:** Validate, document, and route.
* **L2 Role:** Receive valid threats, perform deep forensics, and execute remediation (containment/cleaning).
* **Communication:** The critical link to external stakeholders (IT, HR, Management).

## 2. The Reporting Lifecycle
The goal is to create "Actionable Intelligence." A report is useless if the next person has to redo your investigation.

### Step A: The "5 Ws" Framework (Standardization)
Every report must follow a strict schema to ensure no critical data is lost during handoff.

1.  **Who:** The entity involved.
    * *User:* `m.clark`
    * *Privilege:* `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` (Highest risk).
2.  **What:** The specific action.
    * *Action:* Executed `revshell.exe` via `cmd.exe`.
3.  **When:** The exact timestamp (SIEM time, not current time).
    * *Critical:* Helps correlate with other logs (e.g., firewall traffic at the exact same second).
4.  **Where:** The location.
    * *Host:* `DMZ-MSEXCHANGE-2013` (High value target).
    * *Path:* `C:\Users\Public\` (Common malware drop zone).
5.  **Why:** The Verdict justification.
    * *Reasoning:* "Parent process is IIS Worker (w3wp.exe) spawning a shell. This indicates a web shell exploitation."

### Step B: The Decision Matrix (Escalate vs. Close)
Not every validated alert goes to L2. You must filter based on the "Alert Funnel."

| Status | Definition | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **False Positive** | Benign activity (e.g., Admin testing). | **Close.** Add note: "Authorized activity per Change Request #123." |
| **True Positive (Low)** | Minor policy violation (e.g., P2P software). | **Close (usually).** Send automated email to user/manager. (Check specific SOC policy). |
| **True Positive (High)** | Active threat (Phishing, Malware, Root access). | **Escalate.** Assign to L2 immediately. |
| **Uncertain** | You cannot confirm if it's safe or malicious. | **Escalate/Request Info.** Do *not* guess. Ask L2 for a second opinion. |

### Step C: Escalation Protocol
When moving a ticket from L1 -> L2, follow this "Handshake":

1.  **Update Status:** Move from "In Progress" to "Escalated" (or reassign owner to L2).
2.  **The Handoff:**
    * **Procedural:** Assign ticket in the system.
    * **Direct:** Ping the L2 on shift (Slack/Teams). *Crucial for Critical alerts.*
3.  **No "Throwing over the fence":** You remain responsible until the L2 acknowledges receipt.

## 3. Communication Procedures (Crisis Management)
The system breaks down when people panic. Follow these rules when standard workflows fail.

* **The "Silent" Attacker:** If you suspect a user's communication channel (Slack/Email) is compromised, **do not** contact them there. Call them on a mobile phone.
* **The Unresponsive L2:** If a Critical alert sits for >30 mins with no L2 response:
    1.  Call L2 directly.
    2.  Escalate to L3.
    3.  Escalate to SOC Manager. (Do not jump straight to Manager unless necessary).
* **The "Missed" Attack:** If you realize you closed a ticket yesterday that was actually malware:
    * **Do not hide it.**
    * Re-open immediately and inform L2. Time is the enemy; hiding mistakes helps the attacker.

## 4. Technical Indicators in Reporting
When writing the "Why" section, focus on these proof points:

* **Email Analysis:**
    * *SPF/DKIM Fail:* The sender is not who they claim to be (Spoofing).
    * *Urgency:* "Action Required Immediately" (Social Engineering).
    * *Attachment:* `.zip` or `.html` attachments from unknown senders.
* **Web Shells:**
    * *Process Tree:* `w3wp.exe` (Web Server) -> `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe`. Web servers should serve pages, not run commands.
* **Reconnaissance:**
    * *Commands:* `whoami`, `net user`, `nltest`. These are "enumerating" the network to find the next target.

## 5. Operational Reality
* **Documentation is Evidence:** In a legal breach, your notes are evidence. "I think it's bad" is useless. "Hash X matches Trojan Y on VirusTotal" is evidence.
* **The "Bus Factor":** Write every report as if you will be hit by a bus tomorrow. Can the next person understand exactly what happened without asking you?
