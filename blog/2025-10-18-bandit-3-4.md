# Bandit Level 3 to 4

Login : ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220  
password : MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx  
  
Theory lil bit:  
`cd` command is used to change directory   
`cd ..` goes to the parent directory  
`cd /` goes to the root directory  
`cd ~` goes to the home directory (of the current user)  

`ls` command shows only non-hidden files. However, with the `-a` flag it shows all files, specifically also the hidden files.

### solution:

```bash
bandit3@bandit:~$ ls
inhere
bandit3@bandit:~$ cd inhere
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ ls -a
.  ..  ...Hiding-From-You
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ...Hiding-From-You
